## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Create `e2e/minimap-insert.fixture.html` with a button to insert content between two "target" matches.
- [x] 1.2 **Red**: Add a test in `e2e/minimap.spec.ts` that captures the position of the second match tick, clicks the insert button, and (failing initially if it doesn't update) expects the position to have changed.
- [x] 1.3 **Green**: Ensure the implementation (already using ResizeObserver or similar) correctly updates the minimap and the test passes.
- [x] 1.4 **Refactor**: Clean up any test code or fixtures.
