## 1. Implementation

- [x] 1.1 Scaffold e2e test files for minimap functionality in the `e2e/` directory, adopting an accessibility-first locator strategy (e.g., prioritizing `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`, `getByText`).
- [x] 1.2 Create a test fixture for a non-scrollable page and write tests to verify minimap behavior using a11y locators.
- [x] 1.3 Create a test fixture for a scrollable page and write tests to verify minimap stability (no movement or indicator updates) during scrolling, using a11y locators.
- [x] 1.4 Create a test fixture with dynamically loaded content and write tests to verify minimap updates using a11y locators.
- [x] 1.5 Write tests to verify minimap behavior during window resizing using a11y locators.
- [x] 1.7 Ensure all tests are green.
- [x] 1.8 Refactor tests for clarity and maintainability, ensuring a11y locator best practices are followed.
